				New Zealand is home to 17.5 million tonnes of waste every year. With more than 70% of that landing itself in landfills. The opportunities with business and resources are put to waste, and most importantly the impact on the environment.
				<P></P> 
				308,169 tonnes of plastic waste is going into landfills and only 45,000 tonnes are collected to be recycled. Right now New Zealand imports around 570,000 tonnes of materials such as raw resins and plastic. This also includes 1,200 tonnes of recycled polypropylene every year. The reason polypropylene is being imported is its multi use regarding applications, from everyday use products to medical grade material that can be sterilized properly. Currently this material is worth between $1,300 to $1,700 NZD per tonne. For such a high value recyclable material it is only found that 50% of it gets recycled, although this has been an improvement compared to past years, but this means the other 50% ends up in the landfill.
				<p></p>
				In New Zealand there are 581 registered facilities and 193 landfills across New zealand. These landfills received 7.03 tonnes of material for breaking down with 89.2% being waste disposed of.

					Every year in New Zealand millions of tonnes of rubbish are dropped on the ground, one of the biggest offenders is single use plastic products, such as straws, cups and bottles, these products end up littering the environment and typically end up in rivers and oceans, another huge issue in New Zealand is littering,  according to waste composition based on council data, 31% of all pollution in New Zealand is organic, meaning fruits, vegetables and other foods, which typically get turned into compost. Another surprising source of waste is timber, which makes up around 14% of waste, this is people cutting down trees, and businesses leaving out pallets that could have been put to use into the waste. Although organic and timber waste make up over 45% of waste in New Zealand, the waste we typically see daily is plastic waste, this is also the most preventable type of waste, as it is very easy just to find a bin and put the plastic inside of it. But lots of people do not do that, which leads to our precious lands being littered in.
