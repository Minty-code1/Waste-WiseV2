                    Rubbish waste has become a big problem in Rodney College, everywhere we go, there is constant litter scattered, which creates an
                    unpleasant and unhygienic school environment, we see that many people complain about it but nobody stands up to the issue. One of
                    the main causes of this issue is the free school lunches, where people take half eaten lunches and throw the rest of the lunch onto
                    the ground or just leave their packaging lying around without bothering to dispose of it properly. This behavior shows a broader
                    issue of laziness and lack of responsibility among the students. The result of this is that it makes the school unhygienic and creates
                    an environment which is not ideal for learning in. To help prevent this, we are attempting to spread awareness of this issue, and after
                    speaking to staff members with authority, we have encouraged them to tell teachers to give out ‘Rodney Rewards’, which is a reward
                    system at Rodney College for students showing school values. By picking up rubbish around the school and making Rodney College a cleaner
                    and greener place ‘Rodney rewards’ will be given to students.

                    The type of pollution most commonly found in schools is land pollution, a significant contributor to
                    this pollution is food waste, especially in schools such as Rodney College where free lunches are
                    provided to all students that attend. This results in some students throwing away their food irresponsibly
                    or throwing them into the rubbish bin instead of recycling the containers.
                    <p></p>
                    To fight the problem of food waste causing pollution at schools such as Rodney College, there are a few steps
                    we could take. Firstly, we could educate the students about why throwing away food is bad for the environment
                    and why it's important to be careful with leftover food. Secondly, we should make sure that there is only enough
                    food for the students that will take it, as sometimes there is food for all the students but about half will not
                    take a lunch, this results in a lot of food being wasted. Thirdly, we could set up a way to compost food scraps
                    instead of throwing them away, this would result in the food scraps being used for other purposes such as growing
                    plants instead of the scraps being wasted. We could also make it easy for students to recycle containers and
                    packaging by putting recycling bins in the right places, preferably places where groups of students tend to
                    hang out and outside by the courts, this ensures that there is always somewhere for the students to recycle
                    their containers, because i think a big reason that students don't recycle is because the bins are too far away,
                    so they just throw the containers on the floor.
                    <p></p>
                    We could also keep reminding students every week about the importance of taking care of the environment and
                    check up regularly to see if our precautions for minimizing food wastage are working.
